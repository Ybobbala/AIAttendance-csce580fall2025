        "I began by downloading all available attendance sheet images from the provided Google Drive link and arranging them in chronological order. Although the dataset was expected to contain 27 class sessions, two major inconsistencies appeared during organization:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class 23 had no image at all, meaning no attendance record existed for that session.\n",
        "* Class 25 appeared twice due to a duplicated image; the redundant copy was discarded.\n",
        "\n",
        "After removing the duplicate and acknowledging the missing Class 23 sheet, a total of 26 valid class sessions remained.\n",

        "> Attempt 1: OCR-Based Extraction (Failed)\n",
        "\n",
        "* My initial approach was to use OCR tools such as Tesseract and EasyOCR to automatically extract names and attendance marks from the images. However, this approach proved ineffective because:\n",
        "    * The sheets contained handwritten text, which are messy or stylized.\n",
        "    * Scan quality varied significantly some sheets were dark, skewed, or low contrast.\n",
        "    * OCR produced garbled text, including: misspelled names, missing or merged characters, inconsistent recognition across sheets. Due to these limitations, OCR was not reliable enough to produce usable structured data.\n",

        "> Attempt 2: LLM-Assisted Extraction (Successful)\n",
        "\n",
        "* To overcome OCR limitations, I switched to LLM-based handwriting interpretation, which proved far more accurate. The LLM was able to:\n",

        "1. Combining all Excel sheets\n",
        "\n",
        "    * All class-wise .xlsx files were programmatically merged into a single  table.\n",
        "    * A new column, class_number, was added so every row clearly indicated which class session it belonged to.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Removing empty or invalid entries\n",
        "\n",
        "   *  Rows where both Name and username were empty were removed, since they do not correspond to any student.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Dropping unnecessary columns\n",
        "\n",
        "   *  The No. or serial number (S.No.) column found in the extracted sheets was removed because it served no analytical purpose and was inconsistent across sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Final output is the cleaned and combined dataset that contains: 26 valid class sessions, a unified schema across all rows, No duplicate class files, No blank student entries, A clear class identifier (class_number)"

        "2. I would also build a small name-matching model that learns from manually corrected examples. This would automatically fix common spelling errors and fuzzy-matching issues in names and usernames.\n",

        "3. Another improvement would be adding automatic file-completeness checks, so the system can detect missing class images (like the missing Class 23 sheet) or duplicated ones (such as the duplicate Class 25 image).\n",

        "4. Finally, I would use the Blackboard course roster as a master reference sheet to correct extracted names/usernames and ensure consistency across all sessions, and I would add simple visualizations to summarize attendance patterns more clearly."
